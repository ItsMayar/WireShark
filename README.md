<h1>Computer Security using Wireshark</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Conducted a network security analysis project using Wireshark, a powerful packet sniffing tool, to capture and analyze data communications across FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols. The project focused on intercepting and examining transmitted messages and credentials, such as usernames and passwords, to evaluate the security implications of these protocols. The analysis highlighted the vulnerabilities in unencrypted protocols (FTP, HTTP) and demonstrated the enhanced security provided by HTTPS through encryption, reinforcing the critical need for secure communication channels in protecting sensitive information.
